# Welcome to my Week 2 IP 1
<p>This has the following objectives:</p>
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>The main branch correctly has tests from the test branch. The commit history clearly shows a merge between the 2 branches</li>
    <li>Bot messages can be seen in the slack channel. Messages include a link to heroku and a build ID.</li>
    <li>The Jenkins file correctly does the following (take 1 pint for each missing one): - A JenkinsFile is included in the repo - File correctly includes the necessary tools (1 point) - File includes a build, test, and deploy stage - The file is correctly hooked to the studentâ€™s repository - The file correctly installs node and other dependencies - File correctly tests the project, and emails the student on failure.</li>
    <li>A heroku website with the relevant milestones can be found.</li>
    </ul>
